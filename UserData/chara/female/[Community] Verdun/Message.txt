Hello, There's no important readme here or anything this is just an explanation.

Most these cards were made in my spare time since 2018. I spent hours in vanilla, and this repack
Just creating stuff. Usually 1-3 hours per character, 1 being the most common on test characters.
(I originally had all the characters with their names backwards so most cards say 7/15/2019 besides a few now lol)

Why do I mention this? Well, a lot of characters seem to repeat looks or have deceitful looks. I just wanted to say
Many of these characters were made with the intent to push bounderies, learn off of (for me anyways) and explore
all the things I could make using this game. While they're probably nothing interesting to a commoner I decided 
I would release all of them instead of hording the cards to collect virtual dust on my HDD. 

None of these are based off of anything, they're mostly on spot of what looked "Good" to me at the time.
If it wasn't that, it was something I made for a scene, and then ended up fleshing out in my spare time.

***One last note***
Some characters are futa, this was all part of the testing process. If you want to remove the dong from the 
character simply edit the card, go to Body, the Uncensor selector, and select "None" for "Penis" I would also
recommend removing the pubic hair from said characters accessories as making said characters futa meant I had to
shape the pubic hair around their genitals. This also went down to clothing. 

-All and all I hope you enjoy the characters. I spent more time than I should have assembling them and I may begin
doing so again soon.
