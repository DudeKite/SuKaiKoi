Hello there! (^_^)v

- What is this?
---------------
These tools are for aspiring modders using my packs, as a easy way to get the most essential tools for modding the game yourselves.

- I'm having trouble and need help
----------------------------------
While I dabble with modding from time to time, I am by no means the best person to offer support on these, so you might want to visit the links to each of the mods and get help that way or drop by the Koikatsu server and ask for help in the #mod-programming or #mod-modelling channels, depending on what you're trying to mod.

- What's here, and what does it do?
-----------------------------------
There's a few tools here, these are as follows:

--> SB3Utility
    Allows you to edit assets inside unity3d files, not quite the unity3d full pack, but quite handy for most modding tasks.

--> dnSpy
    Allows you to peek in on plugins, making modification, as well as decompile both plugins and executables
	
--> ZipStudio
	A tool for converting Koikatsu mods to sideloader.
	

There are more tools that makes little sense to include here that I reccomend, you can find these here:

--> Notepad++
    A powerful text editor.
	https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

--> Visual Studio 2019 Community
	A free more feature rich coding environment from Microsoft.
	https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/
	
--> Visual Studio Code
	A free and lightweight code editor from Microsoft.
