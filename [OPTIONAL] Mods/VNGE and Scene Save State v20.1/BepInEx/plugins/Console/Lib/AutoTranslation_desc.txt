Desc for Auto Translation feature
------
VNGameEngine since version 5.0 support AutoTranslation, so you can try to play a VN game on your own language, or make translation.

How to get it?
1. Download and install AutoTranslator from here:
https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator/releases

There are releases for IPA (for Studio and NEO), and Bepis (for CharaStudio). (If you play Koikatsu on English, you may have it already installed)
Tested at version XUnity.AutoTranslator 2.5, you need at least it.

2. Run Studio once. And close it.

3. Find file in Plugins or Bepis named AutoTranslator.ini
Change it somelike this:
(key is Language (target language) and FromLanguage (vn game original language))
(also IgnoreWhitespaceInDialogue=False and MinDialogueChars=400 for adequate processing English dialogues)
(also disable other TextFrameworks - some of them generates errors for me)

[Debug]

4. Set in vngameengine.ini option
UseTranslator=1

5. Run game and play.
I hope translation works.
Note: translation will not work on Title Screen, so you must navigate further.
