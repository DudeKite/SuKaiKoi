Spooktober Koikatsu mod v1.2

Makes the main game menu spooky. Recommended to use during Spooktober for increased spookiness and immersion.

## How to install
1. Remove your \BepInEx\IntroClips folder if you have it.
2. Extract contents of this archive to your game folder.

## How to remove
To completely remove the mod (why would you?!) you have to delete the following folders:
    \BepInEx\BGM
    \BepInEx\IntroClips
    \BepInEx\translation\Images\Koikatu\Scenes\Logo
    \BepInEx\translation\Images\Koikatu\Scenes\Title
And the following files:
    \BepInEx\translation\Images\Koikatu\Logo.txt
    \BepInEx\translation\Images\Koikatu\Title.txt
    \mods\[uppervolta]Dark Loading Screen.zipmod
You might need to re-apply interface translation to get the main menu buttons translated again.
    
Doot doot
